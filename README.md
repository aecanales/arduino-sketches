# Arduino Sketches
Collection of simple sketches I've written as I've learned how to use different components. Tested with `Python 3.6.4`, `pygame 1.9.4`, `pyserial 3.4` and the Arduino Uno compatible [RedBoard.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/redboard-vs-uno/all)

I use `pygame` to write simple interface to display what is being read from the Arduino. If you're unfamiliar with the package, I recommend [this tutorial.](https://nerdparadise.com/programming/pygame/part1)

Code written with VSCode. Definitely a great choice, give it a try if you haven't! Hardware hookup schematics made with Fritzing.
